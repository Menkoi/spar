        What is Spar?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Spar is the the newest app to hit the market. 
        With Spar you can find other Spar users in your local area and 
        challenge them to a fight. With our intutive ranking system, you can rise 
        through the ranks and be at the top in your area. Once you challenge 
        another fighter a request will be sent, if the request is approved 
        then a chat will unlock to setup a time and place. Once agreed 
        all you have to do is fight your way to the top!
